### Skills:
* I am a full-stack specialist product data scientist. In other words, I apply data science to improve a product, business model or business strategy - from the consulting phase, right through to building and monitoring success of the data solutions.
* I spend a _lot_ of time thinking, reading and writing about technology's impact on humans and the planet, and how we (tech companies) can do a _much_ better job at making the world a better place in the long term
* I am an ex-product manager, and during my Master of Business Administration (MBA), I was awarded the class trophy for business strategy.
* My calling is finding _meaningful_ applications of data science, machine learning and intelligence augmentation (like GPT) to help us be better and more wholesome humans in a sustainable way. In other words, I will use my mix of techno-philosophical, product, strategy and data science skills to find a long term and profitable way for your business to serve society - and can execute that data strategy for you
