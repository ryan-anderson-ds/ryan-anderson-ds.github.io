### Consulting services
I am employed as a senior data scientist at a large tech firm in Canada, but have loads of spare time! Therefore, I offer part time consulting as a side-hustle.

### What do I specialise in?
* I am a specialist product data scientist. In other words, I apply data science to improve a product, business model or business strategy. * In fact, I am an ex-product manager, and during my MBA, I was awarded the class trophy for business strategy.
* My calling is to Finding _meaningful_ applications of data science, machine learning and intelligence augmentation (like GPT) to help us be better and more wholesome humans in a sustainable way. 
* In other words, I would like to use my mix of product, strategy and data science skills to help your business to find a more sustainable and meaningful place in this world.
