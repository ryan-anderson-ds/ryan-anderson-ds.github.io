**Data**

I came across a dataset of 47000 answers to a Self Esteem psychometric test from [OpenPsychometrics.org](
https://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/). I scored the tests using the intended [Rosenberg's Self Esteem Scoring Method](https://fetzer.org/sites/default/files/images/stories/pdf/selfmeasures/Self_Measures_for_Self-Esteem_ROSENBERG_SELF-ESTEEM.pdf), and averaged the scores out per country.

I won't attempt to explain why self esteem is higher in certain places, but am comfortable in making several observations and one small theory:

* For surveyed users, where enough results are present (arbitrarily chosen as 20), self esteem is higher in African, Asian and Central American countries: Jamaica and Ethiopia both score almost 30, with the lowest being Latvia and Lithuania at 21.
* Some countries bear noticeable exceptions to the self esteem portrayed by their general region: Latvia, Lithuania, Switzerland, Iceland and Brazil.
* The stark contrast between Ethiopia and Kenya, neighbouring countries, is very interesting. The same goes for France and Switzerland, and Georgia and Russia.
* There are probably many different reasons for these - cultural, geographical, political, socioeconomic and even potentially language and survey translation. However, one theory that I have for the third world countries in general is that the users fortunate enough to have the education, internet, time and will to fill in a survey like this have high self esteem due to their higher perceived position in society relative to others.
