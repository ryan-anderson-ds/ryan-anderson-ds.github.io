title: What I’ve learnt moving from a Product Manager to a Data Scientist role in big tech
type: insights
---

Over a year ago, and after several years of study, I recently took the path less traveled. I stepped “down" from a Product Manager role to a Data Scientist role. I say “down,” because many people used that word when referring to my move. They wondered why I was leaving my career of “making decisions” and “management” to a “lesser” career of being an “individual contributor.” Some told me to my face that I was doing the wrong thing. That I'd be back.

Everything they said was wrong. Life has been so much more rewarding. The decisions I am helping make - and *contributing* with others - it’s NOT an individual contributor role - are at such a more impactful level than that of a Product Manager. I am working higher up in the company, feeling more rewarded, less stressed, and having a more impactful career. Most importantly, every day is filled with flow. Of course, this will not be the same for everyone. Some people are built for management. It took me far too long to realise that I was not.

So what have I learnt, coming from a career in Product Management to Data Science?

Data Scientists (or similar roles) tend to fall short in a few areas:

Business acumen and intuition
-------
Many Data Scientists and Analysts, despite needing to connect the business world to the data world, have a huge shortcoming in business acumen. This makes sense. They generally come straight from university, into a technical role, and then try to fit into their business domain. But they have not managed large projects, or really been part of the non-technical business world. Their intuition is just… missing. There’s not much that can be done here, except to strive, as a Data Scientist, to delve as deep into the business decision-making process as possible. Try not to be put aside and used as a tool when an analysis or model is needed. Try to lead business, rather than to follow.

Doing the wrong work
-------
As a result of poor business acumen, Data Scientists or Analysts often do very complicated work in the wrong direction. For instance, developing a beautiful model that solves a problem that doesn't even need a model. Building a dashboard that is never used, because it doesn’t have useful metrics.


Saying no
-------
New data scientists don't know how to say no, or to manage their time. This is probably the most important skill you learn as a Product Manager, because you run on very limited resources, whilst management ask the world from you. As a Data Scientist, it is no different - but you haven’t typically developed the skillset to (sympathetically) say no to work, and ask them to chat to your manager, or with you, about prioritising it for the future. By saying “no, but perhaps later,” you enable yourself in two ways. First, you get to concentrate on the task at hand and do a good job at that. Secondly, you open the door to the right prioritisation conversations with your management and stakeholders. You then get to do the most important work, first.

Furthermore, analytics roles are not transparent about the time they take to do their work or the difficulties they face. As a Product Manager, I really didn’t appreciate how much effort went into the simplest bit of data engineering or analysis. As a Data Scientist, sometimes the simplest thing can get in the way, and what seemed like a 20 minute query to write becomes three days. It’s not your fault. It’s important to communicate with management about all the obstacles in your way, so that they can help you out with them (escalation is great!), as well as get a bit more… reasonable - in their estimations.


One main tip for for Product Managers (and managers of PMs)
-----
The advice fortunately goes both ways here. If I could go back in time, and be a better Product Manager, there is one enormous thing I'd try to do better.

I'd prioritise the data my products produced as much as the new features we were putting out. It seems like data is always an afterthought, because management pushes hard for features at a particular date, or else. Months, or years later, the same management needs to make a decision, and oh no! The data they need for said decision is not available, or is often missing. Prioritising data as much as features may not pay off in the short term, but in the long term your company will benefit massively from having the data they need to make decisions, from before they knew they needed the data.


TL;DR for your analytics career
------
These four points could be summarised as one - find a way to do as little work as possible, in the right direction. This is a win for you, and a win for the business. Communicate why you're doing what you're doing along the way.
